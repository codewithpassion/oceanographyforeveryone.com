					<p>We believe that the more people who are not just curious, but also capable of studying the ocean, with access to scientific instruments that are functional and reliable without breaking the bank, the better the ocean will be. By empowering a flotilla of researchers, explorers, and citizen scientists to contribute to the monitoring of their local water bodies, we can better protect and defend these essential ecosystems.</p>

								<h3>OpenCTD.</h3>
								<p>Conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD). With these three measurements, marine scientists can unlock ocean patterns hidden beneath the waves. The ocean is not uniform, it its filled with swirling eddies, temperature boundaries, layers of high and low salinity, changing densities, and many other physical characteristics. To reveal these patterns, oceanographers use a tool called the CTD. A CTD is found on almost every major research vessel. Rare is the scientific expedition--whether it be coastal work in shallow estuaries or journeys to the deepest ocean trenches--that doesn’t begin with the humble CTD cast. </p>
								<p>Three years ago, we attempted to crowdfund a low-cost, open-source CTD for science, education, and outreach.

							<h3>Niskin3D.</h3>
							<p>The Niskin bottle, a seemingly simple tube designed to take water samples at discrete depths, is one of the most important tools of oceanography. Coupled with a CTD, an array of Niskin bottles fit into a rosette provides everything an oceanographer needs to profile the ocean. Niskin bottles are neither cheap nor particularly easy to use. A commercial rosette requires a decent-sized winch to launch and recover, which means you need a vessel and a crew to deploy. For Rogue Ecologist and citizen scientists, getting a high-quality, discrete water sample is a perpetual challenge. With tools like the OpenROV and the soon-to-be-completed EcoDrone, we wanted a Niskin bottle that was light weight and capable of being mounted on both underwater robots and quadcopters with ease.And we wanted it to be 3D printable</p>
							
							<h3>Current Status</h3>
							<p>The Niskin3D was tested extensively on Lake Superior while mounted to an OpenROV. It functioned well with no misfires and is ready to be deployed into the broader community for testing.</p>

							<h3>Current Objectives</h3>
							<p>Field testing in a variety of conditions using ROV mounted, drone mounted, and free deployment. Integrate with OpenCTD.</p>
							
							<h3>How you can help</h3>
							<p>When combined with a CTD, an array of niskin bottles forms the most important tool for oceanographic research. We need to develop a mounting system to combine the OpenCTD with several Niskin3Ds and modify the OpenCTD source code to trigger different bottles at preset depths. It's a big job. We also need filed testers ready to print their own and beet them up.</p>
